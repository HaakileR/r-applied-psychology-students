## About the project

This repository contains open learning materials for students of applied psychology who are beginning to use **R** for data analysis in psychological research.

The materials are designed for teaching, workshops, guided exercises, and self-study. They combine:

- synthetic psychology-style data;
- annotated R scripts;
- data cleaning examples;
- scale scoring and reliability analysis;
- descriptive statistics;
- visualization with `ggplot2`;
- group comparisons;
- correlation and regression analysis;
- templates for reporting results;
- documentation prepared for citation and Zenodo DOI release.

The project supports reproducible, transparent, and open research practices in psychology and the social sciences.

## Intended audience

These materials are intended for:

- undergraduate students of applied psychology;
- master students in psychology and social sciences;
- early-career researchers learning R;
- teaching assistants and instructors preparing introductory data analysis classes;
- students moving from SPSS-based analysis toward reproducible R workflows.

## Learning outcomes

After working through the materials, students should be able to:

1. understand the basic structure of an R project;
2. import and inspect data;
3. identify missing values and variable types;
4. score simple psychological scales;
5. estimate internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha;
6. calculate descriptive statistics;
7. create clear visualizations;
8. conduct t-tests, ANOVA, correlations, and regression models;
9. export tables and figures;
10. report results in a transparent and reproducible way.

## Dataset

The dataset included in this repository is **fully synthetic**. It was created only for teaching and practice. It does not contain real participant data.

The synthetic dataset contains variables often used in applied psychology teaching examples:

- demographic variables;
- study-related variables;
- digital stress items;
- perceived stress items;
- academic motivation items;
- well-being items;
- exam anxiety items;
- scale scores prepared for analysis.

## Quick start

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `r-applied-psychology-students.Rproj` in RStudio.
3. Start with `scripts/00_setup.R`.
4. Run the scripts in numerical order.
5. Use the exercises after completing the relevant scripts.

Recommended packages:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "psych", "broom", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))
```
